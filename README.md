Here is my calculator from The Odin Project!

I used Apple's iOS calculator as CSS inspo and I must say, I'm very proud of the look. If you're an iOS user you'll notice that I added some features like:

- a delete/backspace button for the ability to correct mistakes
- an extra display so that all inputted numbers/operations can be seen

This is a very fun project as it really tested my knowledge of the things I've learned thus far. I was able to do research and learn new things along the way and I'm excited to learn even more and make my calculator perfect.

This is not my completely finished product as there are small bugs I need to fix, however, I'm allowing myself to release my baby out into the world because functionally, it's perfect!
